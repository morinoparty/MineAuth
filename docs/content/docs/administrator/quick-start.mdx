This guide explains the basic setup flow from MineAuth installation to OAuth client registration.

## Prerequisites

- Minecraft server with [Paper](https://papermc.io/) 1.21.5 or higher
- MineAuth plugin installed in the `plugins/` directory

## Step 1: Player Registration

Players need to register before using OAuth authentication. Execute the following command in-game:

```
/ma register
```

A password will be automatically generated and displayed. This password is used for resource owner password credentials (ROPC) authentication.

:::warning[Important]
The displayed password is only shown once. Please copy and store it in a safe place.
:::

### Changing Password

If you need to change your password:

```
/ma change
```

A new password will be generated.

## Step 2: Create OAuth Client

Server administrators can create OAuth clients. Execute the following command in-game:

```
/ma client create
```

A dialog will appear where you can enter the following information:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Client Name | Application name (e.g., "My Website") |
| Client Type | `Public` or `Confidential` |
| Redirect URI | OAuth callback URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/mineauth`) |

### Client Types

| Type | Use Case | Client Secret |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Public** | Browser apps, mobile apps, SPAs | Not required (uses PKCE) |
| **Confidential** | Server-side applications | Required |

:::tip[Recommendation]
For websites using better-auth, select **Public** type. PKCE provides secure authentication without exposing secrets.
:::

## Step 3: Client Management

### List Clients

View all registered OAuth clients:

```
/ma client list
```

### View Client Details

Check detailed information of a specific client:

```
/ma client info <clientId>
```

### Delete Client

Delete a client that is no longer needed:

```
/ma client delete <clientId>
```

### Regenerate Secret

Regenerate the secret for a Confidential type client:

```
/ma client regenerate-secret <clientId>
```

:::warning[Note]
Regenerating the secret will invalidate the old secret. Please update your application settings accordingly.

## Command Reference

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `/ma register` | - | Register as a new user |
| `/ma change` | - | Change password |
| `/ma client create` | `mineauth.client.create` | Create OAuth client |
| `/ma client list` | `mineauth.client.list` | List clients |
| `/ma client info <id>` | `mineauth.client.info` | View client details |
| `/ma client delete <id>` | `mineauth.client.delete` | Delete client |
| `/ma client regenerate-secret <id>` | `mineauth.client.regenerate` | Regenerate secret |
