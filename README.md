# MineAuth

This is a plugin for accessing all moripa from the web. 

## Attention for developers
It is hard to create an API and register it for each plugin, so use softdepend and implement it in hard coding. <br>
Also, when converting from normal class to json, if you make your own encoder, it will be buggy when outputting in openAPI format, so use the data class.
